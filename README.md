# Hello-Django

This is my very first work on Django framework. I have created a calculator and an user authentication by using Django, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and PostgreSQL.Actual file is more than 40 mb so I have decided to compressed it. There is also a template where admin can input dynamic data about the website like travel images, name, description, offers, price and so on.
